# CodePlayground by azhar0i0

A premium real-time HTML, CSS & JavaScript code editor that runs entirely in your browser. No installation, no backend — just open and start building.

## ✨ Features

### Real-Time Code Editor
Write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in separate panels with instant live preview. Changes render in real-time in a sandboxed iframe as you type. Error overlay catches and displays runtime errors.

### NPM Package Imports
Import any npm package directly via the unpkg CDN — no build step required. Add packages like `lodash`, `axios`, or `gsap` from the package dialog and they're auto-injected into your preview.

### Live Preview with Device Simulation
Preview your project on **mobile (375px)**, **tablet (768px)**, and **desktop (full-width)** viewports with a single click. Smooth animated transitions between device sizes.

### Save & Share Projects
- **Local Save**: Projects are stored in localStorage with full project list management.
- **Shareable Links**: Generate instant shareable URLs that encode your entire project. Anyone with the link can view or fork your work.

### Responsive Design
The editor adapts to any screen size. On mobile, code panels stack with tab navigation and the preview renders below. On desktop, panels and preview sit side-by-side.

## 🚀 Getting Started
